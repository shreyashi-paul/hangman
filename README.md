# hangman

Hangman is a web-based game that requires guessing random words. The words are populated randomly, representing all 26 letters of the alphabet.

The user has to guess the correct words, and for every wrong guess, the user will be penalized, such as the hangman steps will begin, and if the user can't guess the word, the man character is hanged.

## Requirements / Purpose

-   MVP
  
A game should start with a word being randomly selected.
A representation of the word made up of underscore (_) characters should display on the screen.
Create a user interface made up of buttons representing all 26 letters of the alphabet.
Clicking a button should register its letter as a 'guess'
If the letter clicked is in the word each underscore corresponding to that letter should be replaced with the letter.
If the letter is not in the word, an additional element to the hangman diagram should be added.
The game should keep track of which letters have been 'guessed' already.
The game should provide a win or loss message depending on the outcome
There should be some functionality to play again.

## Future Goals

-   users can play the hangman game using keyborads at this moment but the plan is to enable this game without a keyboard.
-   Currently the game doesn't show the words that's already been used but the plan is to display those on screen for user reference.
